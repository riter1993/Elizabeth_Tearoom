              <p class="col-sm" id="introText">Hi, I’m Felipe, a travel enthusiast, food lover, and the creator of Elizabeth Tearoom.  Please enjoy my journey of how I share my love and passion with others.
                <br>
                <br>
                Growing up with a mum who worked as a chef and a dad who was always grilling at our neighborhood barbeque parties, some of my fondest memories surround food. 
                <br>
                <br>
                After moving to London and finding myself living and cooking for myself, I wanted to recreate the recipes of my childhood to make me feel closer to home. 
                Not surprisingly, I wasn’t alone. All my friends and roommates did the same. Sharing your food is sharing your life and your memories.
                <br>
                <br>
                After trying so many different tastes and cuisines, learning how to make them was the next step. I would ask my friends to teach me how to cook their favorite 
                meals, and every time I traveled somewhere new, I’d take a cooking or baking class which was my souvenir for the trip.
                I started volunteering to teach cupcake baking classes for children in East London and that’s when I saw how strangers can easily come together and create a 
                closer bond through food.
                <br>
                <br>
                When I moved back to Japan, I missed the variety and easy access to baked goods in Europe. I quickly realized that there was a huge opportunity to share my 
                experiences and stories with people in my country, and make them feel closer to me.
                <br>
                <br>
                A good friend of mine once told me that my love language is food.. and she was not wrong. I guess we forget how we ALL use food to express love: eating dinner 
                as a family, waiting for someone to get home to eat together, bringing comfort food to those having a hard time, bringing baked goods into the office, buying your 
                broken-hearted friend ice cream, buying that friend who lives far away a treat and having it delivered on a special date, or even sneaking some scraps to your pets... 
                that is all love. We all love through food.
